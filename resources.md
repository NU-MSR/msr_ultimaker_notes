# Printing Resources #

1. [This blog](http://support.3dverkstan.se/category/31-guides) contains a great
set of guides for the Ultimaker 2. Of particular interest is the
[visual troubleshooting guide](http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide);
this post has images of a variety of common printing issues, and discusses ways
to fix them.
2. Here are a couple of interesting posts about printing with PLA vs ABS:
[ProtoParadigm: *The Difference Between ABS and PLA for 3D Printing*](http://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/the-difference-between-abs-and-pla-for-3d-printing/)
and
[Make Magazine: *ABS or PLA? Choosing the Right Filament*](http://makezine.com/2014/11/11/abs-or-pla-choosing-the-right-filament/)
